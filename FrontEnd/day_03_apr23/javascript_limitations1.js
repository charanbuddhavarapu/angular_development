let a = 10;
console.log(a) //10

//but if you assign a = sachin, then also it will work
//in JS, we can declare a variable and then assign any kind of value to it, which is not good

a = 'rohit'
console.log(a); // it gives a value as sachin

// but in type script we need to mention the type of variable ,so we cannot have any other value other than that
