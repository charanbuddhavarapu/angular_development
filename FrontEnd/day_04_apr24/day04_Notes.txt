Variabe in JS can be declared using var, const, let

Why do we need to have var, cont and let when their purpose is to just declare the variables

const and let came in ECMA version 6 to come up with certain limitations

VAR ---- 

when java script code is executed, N number od execution contexts are created
meaning 1 global execution context is created to execute global code
for each function call 1 execution context is created
execution context is nothing but the environment in which the current code is executed

---------------------TEMPORAL DEAD ZONE-----FOR LET AND CONST ONLY-------------------------
even if the variable is initialized and declared in the memory, JS won't allow us to  use it until we
cross the line where the variable is declared, until then the value of the variable is undefined

For var, you can declare it in line number 245, but still use it in line 1

--YOU cannot acheieve block scope by using VAR, so need to use let and const
