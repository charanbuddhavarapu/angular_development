1.we have some pre defined functions like
 alert(), prompt(), confirm(),max(),min(),sqrt()
2. User-defined functions: we have to write and use them

-regular function - function dec and func. expression
-in regular function - 'this' value is determined/decided on how/where the function is called
        
-whereas in 'ARROW' function doesn't care how the funtion is called
-it used 'THIS' value from the outer scope

//arrow functions generally are static, so it usually points out to window object, so in some cases regular functions are better than arrow funcions


-----CALL BACK and HIGHER ORDER Functions------------------
// the function that is passed is called call back function
// the function that takes another function as argument is called Higher Order Function

// If we call a regular function as a call back function then this problem of having this = window, inspite of having written 
inside of a class
// so for this reason we can invoke, or call arrow functions only as call back functions, as these arrow functions don't lose the this = student
